# JAVASCRIPT EXECUTION CONTEXT 
### When the Javascript engine scans a script file, it makes an environment called the **EXECUTION CONTEXT** that handles the entire transformation and execution of the code.

*During the context runtime, the parser parses the source code and allocates memory for the variable and functions. The source code is generated and gets executed*

---
> There are two types of exection contexts:

- **Global context**
- **Function context**
---
## GLOBAL EXECTION CONTEXT
### The global execution context is created when a `javascript` script first starts to run, and it represents the global scope in `Javascript`.

## FUNCTION EXECUTION CONTEXT
### A function execution context is created whenever a function is called, representing the function's local scope
